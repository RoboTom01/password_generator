# Random Password Generator
Website for password generater.
Website uses prompts to allow users to generate password based on:
  - Character Length
  - Lowercase ABC values
  - Uppercase ABC values
  - Numerical values
  - Symbol values
  
 Password is then copied to clipboard and displayed on site.
 Values for arrays and strings are then reset to not be stored locally and so site can be reused without page refresh.
 If incorrect values are entered in the number prompt or no Character Group is selected, function ends.
